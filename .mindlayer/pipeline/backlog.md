### Summary
Near-term backlog tracks active/planned V4 work only. Full versioned vision lives in `ROADMAP.md`.

### Details

**Active V4 Foundation:**
- Standardized `ml` command runner foundation with read-only commands first: `ml boot`, `ml load`, `ml status`, `ml diff`, and `ml session`.
- Programmatic ranked loader over global/project indexes with deterministic scoring and archive handling.
- Guarded write commands: `ml save`, `ml clean`, and session writes after explicit approval.
- `ml script` lifecycle command: Signal -> Cut -> Refine -> Implement -> Prove -> Transfer.
- IDE extensions after runtime and SCRIPT flows stabilize.

**Next (post-security hardening):**

**Deferred:**
- Memory-system.md changelog: surface what changed when memory-system.md is refreshed on reinstall.
- Migration guide: document how to adopt new template files (e.g. roadmap.md) in existing installs.
- `ml script` command (V4): walks any user through S→C→R→I→P→T for their project. Ships in global-template as a first-class user feature. Depends on solid Transfer (V3 ml save + memory health) being in place first.

### When to use
Use when choosing the next near-term MindLayer task. See `ROADMAP.md` for full versioned vision.

- [ml-signal-20260516-011] Archive completed signals after transfer — Implement completed-signal archiving as a transfer lifecycle improvement. On transfer, when a signal-backed backlog item completes, preserve the signal record but move it from .mindlayer/pipeline/signals/ to .mindlayer/pipeline/archive/signals/, update active and archive signal indexes, and keep merged/dropped/completed provenance available for future context. Active signals should remain focused on pending or cut-approved work; archived signals carry the why-context while archived stories carry the how-context. Add contract tests for transfer behavior, index updates, legacy fallback safety, and status counts after archiving.
